To build an API for managing books and reviews using Django, you'll need to define endpoints that allow users to perform various operations like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources. Below is an outline of API endpoints for a basic Books and Reviews application:

### Books Endpoints:

1. **Get List of Books:**
   - `GET /api/books/`
     - Returns a list of all books.

2. **Get Book Details:**
   - `GET /api/books/{book_id}/`
     - Returns details of a specific book.

3. **Create a New Book:**
   - `POST /api/books/`
     - Creates a new book.

4. **Update Book Details:**
   - `PUT /api/books/{book_id}/`
     - Updates details of a specific book.

5. **Delete a Book:**
   - `DELETE /api/books/{book_id}/`
     - Deletes a specific book.

### Reviews Endpoints:

1. **Get List of Reviews for a Book:**
   - `GET /api/books/{book_id}/reviews/`
     - Returns a list of reviews for a specific book.

2. **Get Review Details:**
   - `GET /api/books/{book_id}/reviews/{review_id}/`

     - Updates details of a specific review.

5. **Delete a Review:**
   - `DELETE /api/books/{book_id}/reviews/{review_id}/`
     - Deletes a specific review.

### User Endpoints:

1. **User Registration:**
   - `POST /api/register/`
     - Registers a new user.

2. **User Login:**
   - `POST /api/login/`
     - Authenticates a user and returns an access token.

3. **User Logout:**
   - `POST /api/logout/`
     - Logs out the authenticated user.

4. **Get User Profile:**
   - `GET /api/profile/`
     - Returns details of the authenticated user.

### Authentication Endpoints:

1. **Token Refresh:**

These are general endpoints, and you might need to customize them based on your application's specific requirements. Additionally, you should implement proper authentication mechanisms (such as token-based authentication) and ensure that only authenticated users can perform certain actions.
